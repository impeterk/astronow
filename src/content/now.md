## Occupation

Currently I am working as **Senior Web editor in Henkel**. I have been
working there for more then 2 years by now - ‚åö‚úàÔ∏è. I am also working
on web development focused projects, which are outside of the scope of my
occupation, but are helpful in the long run.


## Projects

### Check My Ticket

We have just launched new version web application called **Check My Ticket 2.0** that was developed for our clients to create tickets for our team.
It is a full stack web application created with Vue üíü that communicates via Azure LogicApps API layer directly to our Azure DevOps board.
I have migrated the applications from options API to Componsition Setup API.
I have implemented [**Pinia as state management**](https://pinia.vuejs.org), [**Vue Router**](https://router.vuejs.org) and migrated users from firebase to [**Supabase**](https://supabase.com). 

### Calculators

Currently also working web based value calculators for sales team. Calculators are developed in React in front-end and Java Sprint in the backend. 

### Page Pulse

Outside of my work, I am also working on a React/Remix based full-stack SAAS application. It's based on [**Remix**](https://remix.dev), postgres ([**Supabase**](https://supabase.com)) and fully self-hosted on [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/) opposed to Vercel or Netlify.
