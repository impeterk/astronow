## Occupation

Currently I am working as **Senior Web editor in Henkel**. I have been
working there for 18 months now. I am also working
on web development focused projects, which are outside of the scope of my
occupation, but are helpful in the long run.


## Projects

We have just launched new version web application called **Check My Ticket** that was developed for our clients to create tickets for our team.
It is a full stack web application created with Vue ðŸ’Ÿ that communicates via Azure LogicApps API layer directly to our Azure DevOps board.
I have migrated the applications from options API to Componsition API.
I have implemented [**Pinia as state management**](https://pinia.vuejs.org), [**Vue Router**](https://router.vuejs.org) and migrated users from firebase to [**Supabase**](https://supabase.com). 

## University

I am finishing my second to last semester at university. So I
thorouly working on my thesis, which is kind of related to my
working experience. It is about **Software support in software development**.

## Additional Education

Apart from university I am learning on [CodeCademy](https://codecademy.com). Right now, I am working towards finishing [Full Stack Engeneer](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path) Course.
